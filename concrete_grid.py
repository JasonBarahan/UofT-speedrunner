Module Description
==================
This module contains the concrete classes (Concrete Grids) inheriting from AbstractGrid, each implementing
its graph searching algorithm. Additionally, the module contains other data structures such as Priority Queues needed
for the implementation of such algorithms.
There are two concrete classes:
- DFSGrid, which implements a depth-first search algorithm
- DijkstraGrid, whcih implements Dijkstra's algorithm
