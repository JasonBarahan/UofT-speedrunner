Module Description
==================
This file contains entities used to represent various features of the map in
terms of graphs. Buildings and intersections are represented as nodes, while
paths between these buildings and intersections are represented as edges.
These are represented using an AbstractGrid object which can be further used
to find nearby buildings from a given intersection, and shortest paths
between two buildings.
