<br>
We plan to add support for UNIX-based devices and mobile devices very soon.

<!--
A quick note on detailed documentation, such as how to use the application:

There are plans to switch the currently used CLI to a full GUI for improved UX. I will not write detailed documentation on how to use the application until the GUI switch is completed (to save time).
