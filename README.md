<h3>Introduction</h3>
The <i>UofT Speedrunner</i> is a program for students of the University of Toronto to navigate their way around the St. George campus. This application finds the optimal route between two buildings accounting for common amenities needed by students, such  as coffee shops and dining areas.
You need to get from your dorm to your class, while grabbing a coffee and a sandwich for lunch? No problem, we have you covered! <i>UofT Speedrunner</i> will find the shortest route that allows you to accomplish everything in a tight timeframe!

<h5>Compatible devices</h5>
The program currently functions for Windows and MacOS devices. Other UNIX-based and mobile devices are not supported (yet!)

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Navigate between two buildings on campus</li>
    <li>Find buildings with certain amenities on campus</li>
    <li>Determine multi-stop paths</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use cases</h3>
Some reasons why you might want to use this program:
<ul>
    <li>Determining an optimal path between Myhal Centre and Mining Building while stopping by buildings with an ATM and a coffee shop.</li>
    <li>Determining an optimal path between St. George Station and Wallberg Building while stopping by Sidney Smith Commons.</li>
    <li>Determining the best place to purchase coffee while campus WiFi is non-functional.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known bugs and limitations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Visualizations depend on Folium, which works only on MacOS and Windows.</li>
    <li>Paths generated depend on intersections being identified by the program. Faster paths using non-recognized intersections will not be featured.</li>
    <li>This application does not provide navigation for the Mississauga or Scarborough campus, nor does it provide directions between buildings on different campuses. (sorry!)</li>
    <li>Most UNIX-based and mobile devices are not supported (yet!)</li>
</ul>

<!--
A quick note on detailed documentation, such as how to use the application:

There are plans to switch the currently used CLI to a full GUI for improved UX. I will not write detailed documentation on how to use the application until the GUI switch is completed (to save time).
